# ZotNFound Concept Clone in NextJS

## TODO

- [ ] Figure out how to make it so that React Scan runs instantly
- [ ] Figure out how to make it so that the zoom is zoomed in only to UCI
- [ ] Think and make a react state model so that state is shared nicely between components using React Context
- [ ] Try to remove "use client" from as many components as possible since we want to take advantage of SSR as much as possible for SEO
- [ ] Finishing about page
- [ ] Finishing contact page
