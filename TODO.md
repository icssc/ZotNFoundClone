# TODO List

- [ ] Ratelimit on the Contact User Button along with the inferring user email from authentication for contacting.
- [ ] Potential redesign for this page to look more mordern
- [ ] Making sure that the user is the person that they say they are before doing any db call on the server (`auth()` in clerk) so random people can't just call the db and get data
- [ ] Caching the user profile picture for layout shifts
