# TODO List

- [ ] Email in AddLocationDialog is currently hardcoded placeholder, need to change it to the user's email
- [ ] Changing the statistics on the about page to be linked to the database
- [ ] Using the ShadCN for carousel
- [ ] Potential redesign for this page to look more mordern
- [ ] Making sure that the user is the person that they say they are before doing any db call on the server (`auth()` in clerk) so random people can't just call the db and get data
